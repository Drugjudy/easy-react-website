        {questionText: "As you can recall it is possible to see the silhouette of this young dancer spin in both directions. Heck, some observers can even change the spinning-direction whenever they want. I still struggle, but on few occasions I was able to do just that! Check the questionText below, where two additional representations of the same animation were synchronised and positioned next to the original. The only difference being the coloured contours, which should help you understand this famous illusion better.",

    questionText: "Some people report that they hear the sound of the pylon hitting the ground - a thudding or boinging noise - but not everyone does. It is interesting to note that it seems to be the shaking or shudder effect that seems to create the effect, rather than the visual imagery of the skipping pylon. This is brought out by a cropped version of the GIF that @HappyToast created (see below) that showed just the grass with the shaking effect and people reported that they heard the noise when looking at it. They also reported not hearing the noise when they looked at the GIF without the shake added."

Our brain has a remarkable ability to fill in the blanks.It can also mean we are not used to seeing upside down faces. We have no reference point so we dig into our memory and think of the parts.",
